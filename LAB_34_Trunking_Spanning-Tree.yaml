      The operations team started configuring network devices for a new site
      Complete the configurations to achieve these goals:

      1. Configure interface SW10 to utilize 32-bit values when calculating
      spanning-tree port cost
      2. The trunk between SW10 and SW30 is not operational.
      Troubleshoot the issues and ensure PC2 can ping PC1 (10.10.100.10) across the link.
      3. The port channel between SW10 and SW20 is not operational. The switches should
      negotiate the port channel but this is not occuring. Troubleshoot the issue and
      ensure PC2 can ping PC3 (10.10.100.30) across the port-channel.

      **NOTE: No access is provided to SW20 or SW30 on the exam.
      make changes only to SW10.
      Traffic on all trunks should be restricted to only active VLANs.

      Please ignore VLAN discrepencies (pretend this is vlan 400) and
      configure it with that in mind.
