      Tasks
      The operations team started configuring network devices for a new site.
      Complete the configurations to achieve these goals:

      1. Ensure that port channel PO1 between DISTRO-SW1 and DISTRO-SW2 is operational
      using the LACP protocol. Configuration changes must be made on DISTRO-SW1.
      2. Ensure that traffic on VLAN 10 is carried as untagged traffic between DISTRO-SW1
      and DISTRO-SW2
      3. Complete the Rapid-PVST+ configuration on DISTRO-SW2 by ensuring that it is the
      secondary root switch for all VLANs in the rang of 1-1005
