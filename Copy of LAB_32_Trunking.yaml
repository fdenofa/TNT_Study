      The operations team started configuring network devices for a new site
      Complete the configurations to achieve these goals:

      1. The trunk between SW10 and SW30 is not operational. Troubleshoot the issues
      and ensure PC2 can ping PC1 (10.10.100.10) across the link.
      2. Configure SW10 interface G0/0 for agressive unidirectional link detection.
      3. The LACP port channel between SW10 and SW20 is not operational.
      Troubleshoot the issues and ensure PC2 can ping PC3 (10.10.100.30) across
      the port-channel.
